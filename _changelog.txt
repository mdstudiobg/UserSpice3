# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project was originally based on Version 2.0.2 of UserCake (usercake.com), which was released in 2012.

### 3.2.0 - 2016-02-09
### Changed
- New off canvas menus.
- New cleaner top menus.
- Improvements to the language files
- The code has been de-linted and cleaned up.

### 3.1.0b - 2016-01-24
### Changed
- Removed an extra set of body tags from one of the footers.

### 3.1.0 - 2016-01-23
### Changed
- Deleted some unneccesary files
- Added all the classes that are being used in version 4.0 and are being documented on UserSpice.com.  They are not being used
    in version 3.x, but they are there so users can get to know them.  They're completely optional. 
- Added .htaccess to some folders. Will add more after testing.
- Used Google's own test keys as defaults for ReCAPTCHA - Thanks to user astropos for pointing this out
- Added ini_set("allow_url_fopen", 1); to the top of login and register files to deal with server incompatibilities for some
  users. Thank you so much Em for giving me a day on your server to properly track this down. 
- Thanks to feedback and coding from user astropos, I broke the footer into two files to allow users to use per-page javascript.
- All code was reindented.  




### 3.0.4 - 2016-01-04
### Changed
- Much appreciation to users DaVaR and Dylan

### 3.0.3b - 2016-01-02
### Changed
- Changed the variable and added an = to the footer to prevent an error for some people.
- Removed a space at the beginning of recaptcha.config.php that could have been causing header issues for some people. 


### 3.0.3 - 2015-12-28
### Changed
- Fixed a bug (thanks to user Blur) where the "forgotten password" was being encrypted with the old password hash instead of bcrypt.  
- Began working on DaVaR's (creator of UserApplePie) check to see if the database has already been installed before reinstalling.

- Started Output Buffering in the TopNav thanks to a lot of bug tracking from DaVaR and Blur

### Changed

### 3.0.1 - 2015-12-10
### Changed
- Fixed some bugs in the installer with thanks to Zach for the help
