The plan is to make the install file a lot more comprehensive, which will probably break things from time to time.

In the event the automated installer breaks, feel free to follow these instructions for a manual install.

1. Make sure your database connection settings are correct in models/settings.php
2. Find the sql dump in models/install/includes (sql.sql)
3. Load phpmyadmin or your database tool of choice and import the sql dump.
4. Your default username will be admin and the password is password.
5. Delete the sql dump and zip file from your root directory.
